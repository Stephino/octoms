# OctoMS

A small, self-documenting PHP framework

Project [created in 2011](https://code.google.com/archive/p/octoms/) and ported to GitHub in 2021.

## Getting started

Assuming you have installed a [LAMP Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) on your machine, navigate to your `www` folder and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/stephino/octoms .
```

## Quick demo

You can access this [static DEMO](https://stephino.github.io/octoms/) for a very short introduction to the wizard interface or
you can navigate to the following address:

```
http://localhost
```

## MVC

This project is inspired by [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com)'s approach to a Model-View-Controller and routing.

## In the wild

Although no longer maintained, [Fervoare CMS](https://github.com/Stephino/fervoare) is an example of a fully-featured content management system built with OctoMS.

**Warning!**

Do not use this framework in a production environment; this is an unmaintained study/side-project from 2011.
